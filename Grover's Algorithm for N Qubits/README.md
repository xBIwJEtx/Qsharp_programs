# Grover's Search Algorithm in Q#

This project is implementation of Grove's search algorithm

---

# Configuration

You can easily experiment/play with the algorithm by changing the parameter inside
- **Number of Qubits** → Change the 'N' variable at the line 12 → Example **let N = 4;**
- **Target State** → Change the 'Target' array at the line 16 → Example **let target = [One, Zero, One, Zero];**
